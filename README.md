## 1. How do I approach designing software?
  When I'm designing software, I typically begin by analyzing the project's requirements as thoroughly as I can so that I have a good high-level overview of what it is exactly that I'm creating. Once that's done, I then begin tasking out all of the project's components into category buckets for work distribution later. Once that's done, I then start actually developing the items at hand. This strategy has worked for me really well in the 2+ years I've worked in the CS industry.

## 2. How do I approach developing programs?
  When it comes to actually creating the software, I create a functional minimum-viable product to show to my client to show that the concept works and to initate the feedback look for making the program as user-tailored as possible. The rest of the development time is simply more of these dev/feedback cycles.

## 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
  Computer Science helps me reach my goals by providing me with a fun and entertaining job to provide for my family. Ever since I started working in the CS industry, I haven't dreading waking up to go to work each day.
